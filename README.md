# Shopify Frontend Intern Coding Challenge

Here is the repo containing the code for my challenge
written in the React front-end framework. The core
functionality has all been included and I have added the
extra functionality of having data persist after reloading
the page.

Here is a screenshot of the UI incase there are any problems
with running the app:
